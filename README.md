# Two-Stage LDA - Time Series Analyses

## Overview

The `LDATS` package provides functionality for analyzing timer series of 
multivariate data using a two-stage approach comprised of Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) and Bayesian time series (change point and continuous change)
analyses.

## Status

Package development. [See issues](https://github.com/weecology/LDATS/issues)
for specific pre-package tasks.

## Installation

Install the `devtools` package and then run:

```
devtools::install_github("weecology/portalr")
```

## More Information 

Based on inital work using [LDA to analyze time-series data at Portal by Erica
Christensen, Dave Harris, and Morgan 
Ernest](https://github.com/emchristensen/Extreme-events-LDA).
